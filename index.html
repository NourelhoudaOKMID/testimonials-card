                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've  never written like or code. I needed  
                    some structure from professionals  who can help me learn programming  
                    step by step. I was encouraged to  
                    enroll my a former student of theirs  who can only say wonderful things 
                    about the program. The entire  
                    curriculum and staff did not  disappoint. They were very hands-on  and I never told me well long for 
                    assistance. The agile team project, in 
                    
                    particular, was outstanding. It took  my learning to the next level in a way  that no tutorial could ever use. In  
                    fact, I've often referred to it during  
                    interviews as an example of my  development experience. It certainly  helped me find a job as a full-stack  
                    developer after receiving multiple   
                    offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
