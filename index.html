                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've <br> never written like or code. I needed  <br>
                    some structure from professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> 
                    step by step. I was encouraged to  
                    <br>enroll my a former student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br>
                    about the program. The entire <br> 
                    curriculum and staff did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never told me well long for <br>
                    assistance. The agile team project, in 
                    <br>
                    particular, was outstanding. It took  <br>my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial could ever use. In  <br>
                    fact, I've often referred to it during <br> 
                    interviews as an example of my  <br>development experience. It certainly <br> helped me find a job as a full-stack  <br>
                    developer after receiving multiple  <br> 
                    offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
